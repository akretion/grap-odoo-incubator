This module extends the functionality of point of sale to support product
sectors restricting products display in the Point of Sale, depending of the
product sectors.

This module can be interesting if some cashiers have the right to sell
some products, and not other cashiers.

It can be also usefull if you have distinct point of sale that are saling
differents products, for exemple if your company has a restaurant part, and a
shop part, with two point of sale.
